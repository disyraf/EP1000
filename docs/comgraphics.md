# Computer Graphics

Computer Grapgics is divided into 2 categories:

| Raster | Vector |
|------- | ------ |
| Deals with pixels on screen | Uses mathematical functions or algorithms to display images on the screen |
| Becomes fuzzy when zoomed/enlarged | Stays clear when zoomed/enlarged |
| Used for photographs and image representation | Used for  for logos, signs, fancy text and design files |
