# Prototyping

<strong>Prototyping</strong> is an essential part of building anything from small personal projects to large scale projects led by big organisations. There are many tools and materials that can be used for prototyping. The most common material used is cardboard. 

## Why is cardboard good for prototyping?
Cardboard is a great material for protyping because it is cheap if not free, environmentally friendly and easy to work with. Corrugated cardboard readily collapses along the corrugations when force is applied in a way where one or both ends of the corrugations are not supported. That means that it bends easily in one direction but is extremely resistant to bending in the other. Cardboard can be used in many ways due to its versatility.

## Cardboard prototype
To prove to you that cardboard is really useful, I made a prototype myself.
I made a simple handphone holder, made up entirely out of cardboard. 

## Sketching 
Sketching is the first step to prototyping. It converts whatever is in your brain into the real world. The sketch doesn't have to be pretty. It just has to look like the picture you had in your head. For me, the handphone holder looked like this in my head:

Now, I know that it is not the best looking sketch, but it's something that I can work with. 

## Tools
There are many tools that can be used but I went with the simplest of options - siccors, pen knife and some hot glue. These tools are perfect for the job and they are easily attainable. 

## The Final Piece
Now that the sketch is done. I start to build it it out of cardboard. Here are the step I took to do so:

1 . Draw the pieces on the cardboard

2 .  Use the pen knife and siccors to cut them out

3 . Final Step: Assemble the pieces using hot glue
